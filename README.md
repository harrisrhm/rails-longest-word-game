# README

Implement a “Longest-word game” with a cool web-interface. This challenge will let you access a web-API, and parse JSON data returned by this API.

Background & Objectives: 

- Get familiar Routing, Controllers & Views
- Get familiar with parsing JSON format and accessing API
- Learn how to separate responsibilities of your program into several sub-methods

Specs

- A page to display the game settings (random letters), with a form for the user to type a word. A button to submit this form.
- A page receiving this form, computing the user score and displaying it.

Key learning points:

- What's a HTTP? How is it similar to the structure of API?
- What's a JSON? How is it similar to the structure of a ruby hash?
- Describe MVC
- How could you refactor your code to separate the responsibilities of each method?
